# minecraft_server
I decided to write my own Minecraft server handler, and it *might be* decidedly worse than what's already out there!

As any good Software Engineer will tell you, sometimes you gotta crack a couple of eggs to reinvent the wheel.

Utilizes only native Python packages, so no `pip installs` required!

Made for Python 2.7; if you want to use 3.x then you can wrap those `print`s in parentheses if you want :)
